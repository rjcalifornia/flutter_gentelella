A responsive Flutter application using Material Design that demonstrates how to handle the navigation drawer. For a more details explanation about how this built, please see my blog post at https://dexterx.dev/creating-a-responsive-flutter-application-with-a-navigation-drawer/

Note that this was built using Flutter SDK version 1.10.5 that at time of writing was on the dev channel.
See it running online at https://responsive-navigationdrawer-demo.codemagic.app. It is recommended that you use Chrome as there may be issues on other browsers, such as icons not rendering properly
